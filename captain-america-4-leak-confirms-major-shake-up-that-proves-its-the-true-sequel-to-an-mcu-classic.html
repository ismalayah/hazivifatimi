Similarly, a new leak offering us our first glimpse at a big shake-up no one was asking for appears to be splitting fans down the middle. While some are excited to see the change in action, others don’t see why it needed to be altered at all.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Yes, I’m referring to the leaked look at the new superhero suit (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DisTrackers</a>) set to be worn by Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson in Captain America 4. “Love it,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gushed one fan</a>, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another argued</a>, “It looks cool, just wish they stuck with the suit from The Falcon and The Winter Soldier a little longer.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another asked</a> what we’re all thinking: “Why would they give him a suit in tfatws if he won’t ever wear it again?”</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>While that might be a smart question to ponder from a financial standpoint — why are you spending all that cash on a new suit, Marvel, when you only used the last one for five minutes? — there is a stronger, creative reason for the change in costume and its particular design. It presents the filmmakers’ authorial intent to the audience that they are aiming to measure up to one of Marvel’s finest ever movies.</p><h2 id=h-sam-wilson-s-new-captain-america-suit-reveals-brave-new-world-s-winter-soldier-ambitions data-injectable=false>Sam Wilson’s new Captain America suit reveals Brave New World‘s Winter Soldier ambitions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/captain-america-winter-soldier-e1706553288241.jpg><p data-characters=657 data-current-count=957 data-injectable=true>What’s really striking about Sam’s second Cap suit is how blue it is. In contrast to the one he briefly wore in the finale to The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, it has none of the prominent white detailing that was so in keeping with his comic book costume. Instead it’s a stripped-back, streamlined design whose only concession to color is the traditional American flag-styled midriff section. Some might be disappointed that Marvel is diverting from the source material like this, but on the plus side, you know what this reminds us of? Steve Rogers’ suit in his own second solo outing as Cap, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</p><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>Marvel Studios has been infamously chasing the gritty, spy thriller highs of TWS ever since 2014, with the Multiverse Saga trying and — sadly mostly failing — twiceover already in Black Widow and Mackie’s own The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. By decking Sam out in almost a mirror version of Steve’s TWS suit, however, it signals to the fans that the MCU is attempting yet again to repeat the Phase Two highlight’s success. But this time it might actually pull it off.</p><p data-characters=653 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>One thing that TWS had going for it was its villains, with Sebastian Stan’s conflicted Bucky Barnes serving as its emotional core and Robert Redford’s duplicitous Alexander Pierce adding a touch of old-fashioned Hollywood class. Both Black Widow and Falcon were unfortunately saddled with underwritten villains, but Brave New World can change that. Not only is Ford’s Thaddeus Ross set to be a big obstacle — as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">President of the United States</a>, no less — but Tim Blake Nelson is back for the first time since The Incredible Hulk as the Leader. Throw in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of the Serpent Society</a> and you’ve got yourself a villain-palooza.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=false>Even more pertinently, Sam’s arc in Brave New World closely reflects Steve’s in Winter Soldier. Just as Steve was adjusting to the 21st century in that film, so Sam is still adjusting to becoming Captain America himself in this one. Steve had to go on the run as he went up against a corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D. and Sam may likewise become a fugitive if President Ross turns against him. After what will be over a decade, Marvel might just be delivering Captain America 2‘s true sequel in Captain America 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJompqopJa2r3nAppyroZOWenV5y56YpGWTpLuntdGmqmalkZ%2B8s3nSoZiknV2qvW7Ax5qrZqiipMOmv4yiq6xlpJ2ybsDRrpxmq5Wmwqa4jK2mZpmeYrqkwYyco5qro56wcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
