According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a>&nbsp;Hehir said, "their first date she told me — they're driving along in his truck and he gets on the highway going the wrong way and starts driving at traffic on the freeway." That's an interesting omen for a relationship. Even <a href=#>the way they met was pretty weird</a>. Electra took her coat off at a bar and Rodman refused to return it unless she ate at a diner with him and his friends.</p><p>Hehir remarked, "There are so many little things that we couldn't fit into this." Only with Rodman would it be considered a "little thing" to drive on the wrong side of the highway.</p><p>That wasn't their only "exciting" date. Electra dished on another during an April 2020 interview with the&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>. She began, "One day when the Bulls had an off day from practicing, Dennis said he had a surprise for me." After blindfolding her and putting her on the back of his motorcycle, they ended up at the Chicago Bulls practice facility. She described the day as "crazy" and compared it to being "two kids in a candy store."&nbsp;</p><p>She recalled, "We were eating Popsicles from the fridge and pretty much having sex all over the damn place — in the physical therapy room, in the weight room. Obviously on the court."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hkbYZxe9ahsGaclaO7qr%2BMq6adpZGjeqK6w2aamqqdmrtuscuemq2qkah6rq3Rq6Can5VixKK%2FjK2msaGTZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
