Recommended Videos Following a gap of more than a year, the period rom-com returned for a second season in early October 2023 and promptly blew audiences away. The combined forces of Rhys Darby and Taika Waititi remain as dazzling as ever, leading season 2 to cinch an even higher score over on Rotten Tomatoes than the first."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The combined forces of Rhys Darby and Taika Waititi remain as dazzling as ever, leading season 2 to cinch an even higher score over on Rotten Tomatoes than the first. That’s impressive all on its own, but the show is making stars of far more than its leading men. The entire cast is finding a new popularity among viewers, as obsessed Our Flag Means Death fans find each and every opportunity to enjoy the dazzling talent behind HBO’s latest hit.</p><h2 id=h-who-plays-izzy-on-our-flag-means-death data-injectable=false>Who plays Izzy on Our Flag Means Death?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>Two pirate crews make up the primary cast of Our Flag Means Death. The first make up the crew of the Revenge, captained by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Darby’s Stede Bonnet</a>, and the remainder join the notorious crew of Waititi’s Blackbeard. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Blackbeard’s crew</a> is Israel “Izzy” Hands, Blackbeard’s right hand man and one of the more no-nonsense characters. Izzy is flawlessly portrayed in the series by Con O’Neill, who brings a serious tone rife with comedic undertones to brilliant life.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Con O’Neill’s other work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Con_ONeill.jpg><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Con O’Neill is by no means a newcomer to the media scene, but he doesn’t boast the name recognition Taika Waititi or Rhys Darby boast. He’s starred in a number of projects over the years, however, including several major, blockbuster releases. In the last few years alone he’s got credit in The Batman (as Chief Mackenzie Bock) and Elden Ring, and those 2022 laurels pale in comparison to some of his biggest roles.</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=false>Over the course of his career, O’Neill’s starred in more than 20 film and television shows, alongside his voice work in Elden Ring and Dark Souls II. He was in HBO’s Chernobyl and 2019’s Queens of Mystery, and next year his fans can look forward to more of O’Neill in SAS: Rogue Heroes and The Way of the Wind. They can also look forward to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty more of him</a> through the remainder of Our Flag Means Death‘s sophomore season, and — hopefully — every season yet to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMqaOasaNitrvG2Gamp2Wfqr9ussuanmallZa7tHnDnpitoF2Wu6V51qGYrWWVocCmecearZ5lmWLAprHNZp%2BipV2eu3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
