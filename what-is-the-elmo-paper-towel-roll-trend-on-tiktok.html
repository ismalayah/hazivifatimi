But recently, a new celebrity began trending on TikTok after appearing in a viral video. Everyone has fallen so in love with the post that it has started a trend.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>How did the ‘Elmo paper towel roll’ trend begin?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>On November 26th, 2020, during the third episode of Sesame Street‘s 51st season, actress Hailee Steinfeld guest-starred with the Sesame Street gang for a song titled “I Wonder What If, Let’s Try” in a segment about problem solving. At one point, the scene features Elmo and Rosita discussing the various options in modified rap melody that goes: “An oatmeal container, a wooden bowl, a plastic water bottle, and a paper towel roll.”</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>It’s Elmo’s inflection and cadence in saying “paper towel roll” that fans can’t get over, as the puppet breaks character from his normally soft&nbsp;voice to one with more attitude and emphasis (which, if we’re being honest, does sound funny).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>On December 14, TikToker Chelsey Vogt (known as @cj_vogt on the app) posted a clip of the scene with the caption, “The way Elmo says ‘paper towel roll’ has me dying..I can’t stop watching.” The post quickly gained momentum and — in just six days — was sitting at a hefty 2.9 million views.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@cj_vogt href=#>@cj_vogt</a><p>Why does Elmo sound so sassy? <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=momsoftiktok href=#>#momsoftiktok</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Chelsey Vogt" href=#>♬ original sound – Chelsey Vogt</a></figure><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>Since Vogt’s post, Elmo’s part has been turned into a popular TikTok sound that’s been primarily used in dub skits, inspiring over 28,000 uses during the month of December. So far, the sound has been used for several purposes, with the most entertaining one coming from TikToker @sherelabear as she used the sound to describe how they entertain their baby. The skit managed to get 3.1 million views in four days.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Now, everyone has gotten in on the trend as thousands of users have gathered the household items in their home to create more unique and interesting skits using the sound. But how do you make your own ‘paper towel roll’ post?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true><a title=@chinpals href=#>@chinpals</a><p>Why does paper towel roll slap 💀 <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=MakeABunchHappen href=#>#MakeABunchHappen</a> <a title=petlife href=#>#petlife</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Chelsey Vogt" href=#>♬ original sound – Chelsey Vogt</a></figure><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>It’s really easy to be a part of this trend. All you need are the objects mentioned by Rosita and Elmo in a song: an oatmeal container, a wooden bowl, a plastic water bottle, and a paper towel roll. Just figure out what you’re planning to do with the items, create a skit, record, and post. Of course, if you’re looking to really stand out, you may want to study other posts to come up with a unique way that will set you apart from the rest, but everything else is easy.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>However, in case you don’t have those items just lying around the house, there is also another popular part of the ‘paper towel roll trend you can engage in. And all you have to do is dance.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true><a title=@ttaywhite href=#>@ttaywhite</a><p>it’s so catchy and for what <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=papertowelroll href=#>#papertowelroll</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Chelsey Vogt" href=#>♬ original sound – Chelsey Vogt</a></figure><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=false>TikTok users have also started a new way to use Chelsey Vogt’s sound where they pretend that they are unfazed and bored with the first half of the song, but when Elmo’s part begins, they go crazy over the sound and dance like lunatics. So far, millions of TikToker’s have already recreated the new dance concept and shared them on the app. So, if you’re hoping to join the trend that way, it’s certainly a viable option.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmemnrGmu9JorqGZpGK2tHnToZxmnZyivG68wKmcq2WkpMSmuIyrpqWkXam%2FprrDZqanZaSeuLW7ymg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
