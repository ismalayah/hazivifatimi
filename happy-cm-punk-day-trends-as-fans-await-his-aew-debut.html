Fans can’t wait to see AEW Rampage’s special The First Dance episode, because they are convinced Punk is showing up. They are not alone, because even those outside of the pro wrestling bubble are aware of Punk’s arrival.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>As you can see from the above graphic, “Cult of Personality,” CM Punk’s theme song, is also trending. WWE does not have any exclusive rights to that music, so <a href=#>Tony Khan’s company could certainly use it if they want to</a>. Odds are they will, because Khan has shelled out money for wrestlers’ theme songs in the past.</p><p>“It’s the cult of personality!!! Happy CM Punk day!!!” one fan tweeted out to get into the festivities. This is a day that many pro wrestling fans have waited over half a decade for. CM Punk is making his return to pro wrestling, and AEW will be his landing pad.</p><p>Although some fans don’t want to get their hopes up too much, plenty more are incredibly excited about CM Punk’s AEW being a sure thing.</p><p><strong>Happy CM Punk Day from everyone here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
