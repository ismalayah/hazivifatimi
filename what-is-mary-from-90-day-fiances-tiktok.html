People simply canâ€™t get enough of the drama that absolutely overwhelms Mary and Brandanâ€™s relationship, and it helps that theyâ€™re so easily accessible online.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Mary boasts her own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dedicated Instagram page</a>, where she frequently posts snapshots of herself and the little family she shares with Brandan.
