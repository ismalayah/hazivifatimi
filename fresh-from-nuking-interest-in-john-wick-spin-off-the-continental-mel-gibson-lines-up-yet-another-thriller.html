The easiest way for Gibson to get back into the good graces would seemingly be as a director, with Hacksaw Ridge winning plenty of rave reviews and awards season recognition.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prospect of pulling double duty on Lethal Weapon 5 remains on the table</a>, but for now, Boneyards will see him play an FBI special agent hunting for a serial killer named The Bone Collector, with a potential conspiracy planting a member of local law enforcement as the number one suspect. Sounds like routine stuff, but that’s par for the course with Mad Mel these days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaudo516p77OpmSnrZueu6h5yKernqqVqMFutc1moaignmLEqq%2FKZqqpoZ5ivKeyjK2fnmWTpLu1tc2epa2ZnGK6priMoKCbq5%2Bjeq21zZ6qZq2gYsamwIyapaismJq%2FbsDHq6ClpJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
