Recommended Videos The post-production editors of the long-running NBC parody show are planning an April 1 walkout after negotiations for higher pay and better health benefits continue to drag on.
Back in October, the crew members unionized with the Motion Picture Editors Guild (MPEG), which initially resulted in the guild approaching NBC Universal with a slate of labor proposals in December."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Another issue the guild is spotlighting is that NBCU’s practice of hiring freelance subcontractors hinders the full-time workers’ collective bargaining rights. For obvious reasons, MPEG believes that this labor practice could be abused to negatively effect employees’ fair compensation.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Alan Heim, President of the Motion Pictures Editors Guild, spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, saying, “Strikes are not funny, and it’s also not funny that NBCU is driving us to take this step to guarantee fair pay and benefits for our members.”</p><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>It’s worth noting that MPEG represents approximately 9,000 post-production workers nationwide.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tonight on <a href=#>@nbcsnl</a>, several cast members including <a href=#>@ColinJost</a> wore shirts during the show’s closing in solidarity with <a href=#>@MPEG700</a> — the editorial SNL crew who are WITHOUT a contract right now. <a href=#>@NBCUniversal</a>, time to get to the table & negotiate with your post production crew! <a href=#>#1u</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RsrRkXB1Ys</a></p>— AFL-CIO #PassThePROAct (@AFLCIO) <a href=#>February 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>There is a hint of optimism, however; NBCU sources said that the company is determined to reach an agreement before April 1. Also, SNL cast members <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Colin Jost</a> and James Austin Johnson (known for his pinpoint accurate impression of Donald Trump) wore “contract now” t-shirts at the end of the Feb 3 episode as a sign of solidarity with the crew.

This support is helping to ensure that management will eventually do the right thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0rdOuqZ2ZqWK7qrPHrWSsrKKeuKZ50qejZq%2BRobiwwdNmpKKfmKl6tMDOqWSpqp%2BZwqTAyKilZqGeYra1v4ytqZqbm6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
