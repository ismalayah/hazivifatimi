There's a scene in which Ernest answers some pointed questions, and DiCaprio's squirming under Rodrigo Prieto's hot lights might be his finest, mostly darkly amusing character work since the Qualuudes episode in "<a href=#>The Wolf of Wall Street</a>."<br></p><p>But the heart of the movie, ten times over, is Gladstone, who brings such grace and equanimity to Mollie, who has to navigate an emotional minefield with every line reading. Mollie instantly recognizes Ernest's own wolfishness (she calls him a "coyote") and marries him anyway, staying with him out of a form of faith that he never earns, but that also isn't purely naive.<br></p><p>While oil money has made the Osage richer than the local whites, it hasn't given them more power: Mollie lives in a world controlled by white men, not just Ernest but the doctors who manage her diabetes, a guardian who has a lock on her money, and police who won't investigate when tribal members are murdered. Scorsese has steeped the movie in Osage traditions—it's bookended by rituals—but there is a sense, especially toward the end, that Mollie is, typically for Scorsese, Ernest's confessor in a Catholic sense.</p><p>"Killers of the Flower Moon" is not in competition, but had it been, it's hard to see how any other movie would have rivaled it for richness or mastery.<br></p><p>For more on this film, read Sarah Knight Adamson's <a href=#>essay</a> on the stories behind this picture&nbsp;as well as Chaz Ebert's&nbsp;<a href=#>article</a>&nbsp;compiling Roger's reviews of Martin Scorsese's work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52jqba3rcusZpyZnqOytHmRaWlsZZueua2x0axkqJ5dqbWmecWlprCdomK6sLvN</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
