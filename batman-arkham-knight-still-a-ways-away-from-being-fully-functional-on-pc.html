Crippled by a host of technical problems from day one, many retailers were forced to suspend sales of the PC version until the problems were ironed out; though according to the studio’s latest update, there is still plenty of work yet to be done.
“Rocksteady is leading our team of developers and partners as we work on the PC performance issues that players have been encountering,” according to a post on the game’s official website."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was later revealed that the PC version had been outsourced to Iron Galaxy Studios, where a team of 12 developers purportedly shouldered much of the technical legwork.</p>[zerggaming]<p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>Since then, Rocksteady has been attempting to put out fires left, right and center, and while a vast number of bugs still remain, here’s a list of those eradicated in the game’s maiden patch released yesterday.</p><ul data-current-count=1083 data-injectable=true><li>Fixed a crash that was happening for some users when exiting the game.</li><li>Fixed a bug which disabled rain effects and ambient occlusion.
