Eddie (<a href=#>Eddie Garcia</a>) and Luis (Guzmán) are brothers-in-law who also have successful NYPD detective careers busting up counterfeit fashion rings running out of storefronts on Canal Street. Their work has gotten the attention of French bag designer Colette (<a href=#>Alice Taglioni</a>), who flies to New York, in all her short-skirted, huge-sunglasses French gorgeousness, to ask them personally to help her track down a stolen prototype of one of her bags. The two guys leap at the chance, not just because of the reward money offered to them, but also as an escape from their two very different sets of woman problems: Eddie and Gloria (<a href=#>Rosie Perez</a>, another essential character actor) have been together since they were teenagers, have a bunch of kids, and their relationship is a mixture of boredom and irritation; Luis has been dating Vanessa (<a href=#>Rosario Dawson</a>, very funny in her small role) for a while, but refuses to pop the question. She's furious. Paris represents not only an escape from all of this but a lucrative validation of their competence as detectives.</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, and refreshingly, the "culture clash" aspect of "Puerto Ricans in Paris" is not the driving engine of the plot or the source of the film's energy and humor. Yes, it's funny when Guzmán, in his loud Hawaiian shirt, swaggers up to a snooty French woman on the sidewalk and asks to bum a cigarette, calling her "mami" in the process. There are many such scenes, and they're all funny, but Edelman doesn't milk the situation for all it's worth, as might be expected. Instead, he focuses on the case the guys have been hired to solve and the Byzantine Venn-diagram of suspects, but mostly on their&nbsp;</span>dynamics<span>&nbsp;as a duo and their interactions with other characters. Garcia and Guzmán, who both had roles on Edelman's HBO series "How to Make It in America" have the easy chemistry of guys who have known each other forever.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Eddie and Luis find themselves immersed in Colette's world as she drags them around to parties and nightclubs. She and Eddie form a surprising and sudden bond that has more to do with the struggles of being a parent than anything sexual or romantic. It appears to be a real friendship and Luis looks on with suspicion. Luis strikes out with every French girl he approaches, and cannot understand why Colette seems to prefer Eddie over him. There's a very funny sequence where Eddie is a huge hit at a dinner party, and poor Luis can't get a full sentence out before someone interrupts him. Meanwhile, during the day, Eddie and Luis go undercover as Saudi sheikhs, or international drug dealers, to investigate the different suspects. It is completely ridiculous and completely entertaining.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46prJ6qpKR6s7XCmqWsZZmjerGt0aKqZmpgZoM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
