We have Robbie in the lead role, looking just like the classic version of the doll with her flowing, glossy blonde hair and blue eyes.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Then, there is also Hari Nef as Doctor Barbie, Issa Rae as President Barbie, Emma Mackey as Nobel Prize Scientist Barbie, Ana Cruz Kayne as Supreme Court Justice Barbie; the list goes on and on.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>But then there is Weird Barbie, or Destroyed Barbie as some have dubbed her. This Barbie does not have long glossy locks or perfectly applied make-up, this Barbie has seen some things.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>She is played by the SNL alumni, queen of comedy, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate McKinnon</a></strong>, who we believe is the perfect casting choice. McKinnon sports many of the features of classic Barbie; blonde hair, blue eyes, and great cheekbones, but, much like the actress herself, normal isn’t a part of this Barbie’s vocabulary.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>This Barbie lives rather separately from the others, in her own abstract-looking house. Robbie’s Barbie pays her a visit when her perfect life starts to somewhat untangle in order to get answers, and upon meeting this estranged Barbie she is greeted by a spiky short-haired character with drawings on her face and a less-than-flattering dress.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>This Weird Barbie is, as McKinnon put it in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with Kelly Clarkson, “the one Barbie you designate as ‘her’ where you cut their hair and burn their clothes and draw on them. That’s the one I play.”</p><h2 id=h-where-did-the-idea-of-weird-barbie-come-from data-injectable=false>Where did the idea of Weird Barbie come from?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Barbie-Kate-McKinnon-1.jpg><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Gerwig spoke about her inspiration for this version of the character, which came from many places. The director told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>:</p><p>“Remember that book&nbsp;The Giver, by Lois Lowry, where the giver has all the colors and the feelings and stuff? That’s sort of what I thought about Kate’s character. She would be like the giver in a way like she had the knowledge that everyone else didn’t have.”</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Beyond that though, the character is also one that Gerwig felt a personal connection to from her own childhood.</p><p>“We grew up in a neighborhood where there were a lot of girls older than me. So I had a lot of hand-me-down Barbies that had already gotten a haircut by the time I got them. It was like, “Well, we have to do that.”</p><h2 id=h-why-mckinnon-is-the-perfect-actress-for-weird-barbie data-injectable=false>Why McKinnon is the perfect actress for Weird Barbie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kate-Kate-McKinnon.png><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>McKinnon is a phenomenal comedic actress, which is why Gerwig was drawn to her for this role. The two have actually known each other for quite some time, having been in an improv group together back at Columbia University.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Of working together once more, Gerwig said, “It was like, we’d gotten into a time machine when we were 18 and came out at 39. The reality is, we’re still the 18-year-old kids who are making musicals.”</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>McKinnon also spoke highly of her time playing the character, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23>“I loved that crazy hair. I think my face makes more sense if there’s marker on it. It’s very comfortable to wear a big bell-shaped baby doll. And if anyone gets the chance, I would recommend that they do that.”</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>McKinnon has proven her genius over and over again during her time on SNL. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She started on the show in 2012</a> and earned high praise for her character work embodying the likes of Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Sessions, as well as pop culture figures like Justin Bieber and Ellen DeGeneres.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>She has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on the show numerous times, winning twice, back to back, in 2016 and 2017, becoming the first SNL actor to win the award since Dana Carvey won in 1993.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McKinnon left SNL in 2022</a>, but has worked on numerous film projects throughout her time on the show including Ghostbusters, Rough Night, Office Christmas Party, and Yesterday. This also isn’t the first time she has acted in a film with Robbie, having starred in the 2019 film Bombshell. Alongside Barbie she will also voice a character in the fourth installment of the Kung Fu Panda franchise playing The Chameleon.</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=116 data-injectable=false>You can catch McKinnon as Weird Barbie, permanently doing the splits, in Barbie which is available to stream on Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMqaOasaNixKa10Z1km5mil7amecinZJuZope2pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
