The monster, they are told, is a "Tei Tao," one of a horde of creatures that attacks the now-famous&nbsp;Great Wall of China once every 60 years. William and Tovar are initially unmoved by the Nameless Order's considerable plight; they want to make their fortunes by stealing gunpowder from their hosts, and selling it to European traders. But eventually, William and Tovar's agendas drift apart after William&nbsp;becomes seduced by the formal control and selfless zeal that defines the Nameless Order.&nbsp;</p><p>And who wouldn't be impressed? The Nameless Order marches around in colorful suits of armor that come in hues of indigo, crimson and cerulean. They launch themselves at their enemies using pulleys, bungee cords, hot-air balloons, boulder-spewing&nbsp;catapults, and many, many&nbsp;arrows. Each crowd shot in this film is remarkable, but&nbsp;not because director <a href=#>Zhang Yimou</a> ("Hero," "<a href=#>House of Flying Daggers</a>") and his assistant directors&nbsp;know how to direct extras. On the contrary, the impassive faces of the Nameless Order's soldiers remind us that all of these people, together, are remarkable. In that sense, the scene where William admits that he killed a Tei Tao "alone," without the aid of Tovar or his slain mercenary colleagues, is a&nbsp;significant reminder of the film's communal ideology: William, as an undisciplined&nbsp;loner, must prove that he's worth just as much as a selfless Chinese soldier.&nbsp;</p><p>The film's action scenes also exemplify a sense of precise,&nbsp;shared responsibility that one rarely sees in action-spectaculars. The army works together as a unit, just as the Tei Tao do. You can imagine how hard that philosophy might be to enforce given that&nbsp;it demands a big enough budget to focus on two warring armies' clashing maneuvers. But no, the film's action set pieces are not only thrillingly large-scale, but visually rapturous, despite a preponderance of computer-generated imagery.&nbsp;There are a handful of well-choreographed and well-directed, Damon-centric&nbsp;action&nbsp;sequences, but it's very easy&nbsp;to be seduced by scenes that focus on impersonal warfare. In the latter scenes, the&nbsp;art department flexes their collective muscles with every lionhead-shaped helmet and barbed offensive&nbsp;weapon. Who could remain unmoved after watching a group of individuals dangle, thrust, and throw everything they've got at a&nbsp;legion of deranged-looking creatures?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55ll6eyosCMsJilpF1nfXKD</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
