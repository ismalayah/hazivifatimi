Wikipedia Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alex&nbsp;Fritz, 28, is a former of the USA Climbing team who was arrested this week on three counts of third-degree child rape. He does not have a separate Wikipedia page at the moment but he is listed as a climber who received Silver at&nbsp;Bouldering Youth National Championships.</p><p>Fritz has worked at Vertical World climbing gyms as a coach and route-setter.</p><p>Recently, he is accused of having sexual contact with a girl three times during the summer of 2016 in Bothell, Mukilteo, and Redmond. According to Redmond detective Marshall Tolbert, on Feb. 2, Fritz has several accusations of child abuse.</p><p>An investigator with the US Center for SafeSport contacted Redmond police about accusations that Fritz had “relationships” with child athletes.</p><p>The FBI was called in because Fritz allegedly crossed an international border to have sexual contact with children. However, on July 14, 2021, an FBI agent contacted Tolbert and informed him that the federal agency had declined to take charge of the case.</p><p>Regardless, Tolbert combined FBI reports with evidence gleaned from his own investigations.</p><p>According to one young woman, she met Fritz in 2015 at a climbing competition in Canada. Fritz was 22 at the time, and she was 15.</p><p>She later told police in an interview that the climbing coach began sending her messages via Facebook, Snapchat, and text message. They eventually began to pay each other visits.</p><p>The woman claimed she and Fritz had sexual relations when she was 15 years old. She told detectives that it was not consensual.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-alex-fritz-in-prison-on-child-rape-charges></span>Is Alex Fritz In Prison On Child Rape Charges?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Alex Fritz is currently in prison on child rape charges after he was arrested on Wednesday in Snohomish County, Washington. He was charged with multiple counts of sexual crimes against a minor.</p><p>On Thursday, Everett District Court Judge Anthony Howard set bail at $500,000.</p><p>USA climbing released a&nbsp;statement&nbsp;regarding Fritz on February 5, 2022. “The allegations have deeply disturbed USA Climbing.”</p><p>“As an organization that prioritizes member safety and protection. We want to thank the United States Center for SafeSport and local authorities for their cooperation in promoting that goal,” said Marc Norman, CEO of USA Climbing.</p><p>The victim of Fritz&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;that he would occasionally buy her alcohol prior to the unwanted contact. She described herself as “vulnerable and intoxicated” to the police.</p><p>In the initial probable cause statement, no other victims were identified. “Fritz is suspended from participating in USA Team competitions and SafeSport certified gyms by SafeSport,” Tolbert wrote.</p><p>However, if the gym doesn’t compete in the USA team competition, it is not supervised by SafeSport. And there will be nothing stopping Fritz from offering private coaching or working at a gym with more young athletes.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-alex-fritz-have-a-wife-meet-him-on-instagram-facebook></span>Does Alex Fritz Have A Wife? Meet Him On Instagram, Facebook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Apparently, there is no information regarding his wife and social media. We could not locate him on Instagram as well as on Facebook.</p><p>28 years of Fritz has harmed his entire reputation as a climber and a climbing cach as a result of his heinous action.</p><p>He could be married based on his age, but nothing is certain as long as there is no official statement released.</p><p>We will update you with further information as soon as it is made public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYq6tsddmnauhpK96or7RnqqtnZRirq%2BwjKKlZqiinsCwuoxrb2axlZa%2FbrvLnWScpJmir6q6xmaaqJmTnXqir8Kuqp6cXaSzbq%2FHoqOdZaKWvaZ5kWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
