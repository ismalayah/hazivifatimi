Recommended Videos In a mid-credits reveal following the show’s 2023 Christmas special, viewers got a look at what might just be the good Doctor’s next big mystery: The seemingly innocuous Mrs. Flood, presented through the rest of the story as an unassuming elderly woman, turns to the camera. Looking straight down the barrel of the audience’s soul, she says in a self-satisfied voice, “Never seen a TARDIS before?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Looking straight down the barrel of the audience’s soul, she says in a self-satisfied voice, “Never seen a TARDIS before?” It’s tantalizing. What could it mean?</p><h2 id=h-who-could-mrs-flood-be data-injectable=false>Who could Mrs. Flood be?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>So far, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Davies</a> and company have been conspicuously tight-lipped about who Mrs. Flood might be, with Davies promising that “you will eventually find out more about her. She’s a slow burn, Mrs Flood. Who is Mrs Flood? Come back and find out!” during an episode of Doctor Who: Unleashed.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>In short, the way things stand right now, you’re not supposed to know who Mrs. Flood is. Her identity is a mystery box, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">River Song</a> or the woman in heaven during the show’s eighth season. Maybe that’s why fans seem so sure that she’s River Song, or the woman in heaven from the show’s eighth season.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=890 data-injectable=true>Yes, Doctor Who devotees around the internet are doing what they do, speculating wildly on just who Mrs. Flood might be. As we mentioned, two of the top contenders are the Doctor’s wife – whose history of very damp names makes her an obvious choice – and The Master, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whose return</a> was alluded to at the end of the Fifteenth Doctor’s introduction in the special “The Giggle.” Eagle-eyed viewers noted that Mrs. Flood’s door looked suspiciously TARDIS-ish, and that her ability to break the fourth wall was a particularly Time Lord-adjacent move.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, further theories postulated that Mrs. Flood might be the Rani, another Time Lord villain with unscrupulous scientific methods and, for a while at least, a T-Rex. Speculation surrounding the character’s potential return mostly revolve around the fact that “Rani” is an anagram of “Rain,” which creates Floods. Maybe that’s a stretch, but so is an alien time machine like the TARDIS having a name that’s an acronym in English.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Whether Mrs. Flood is a Time Lord, a different Time Lord, a part-Time Lord, or just an old lady who can see you through your television screen, we won’t have long to wait to find out. Doctor Who’s newest season is slated to debut in May of 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlnafAbrLLqKadZZmjeqW7wq2mq2Wnnbxw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
