Occasionally, the NFL has kicked the Super Bowl off at a weird time, like 6:18 p.m. PST, but they are going with the standard 6:30 p.m. PST this year.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>In 2022, the Super Bowl took place in Los Angeles. This made it the second straight year that the team that played its regular season games got to play in the Super Bowl at its home stadium. In 2021, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played in the Super Bowl in Tampa Bay. Both teams won the big game at their home stadium.</p><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=895 data-injectable=true>This will not be happening in 2023. The host stadium this year is in Glendale, Arizona, which is just outside of Phoenix, at State Farm Stadium. The Arizona Cardinals play here, but unfortunately did not qualify for the playoffs this year. State Farm Stadium has hosted two other Super Bowl events: Super Bowl XLII when the underdog New York Giants shocked the world and beat the undefeated New England Patriots; and Super Bowl XLIX, when the New England Patriots got their revenge and beat the Seattle Seahawks, a game that created one of the most infamous Richard Sherman memes.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-playing-in-super-bowl-57 data-injectable=false>Who is playing in Super Bowl 57?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=596 data-current-count=896 data-injectable=false>So far, fans are not sure who will be playing in Super Bowl LVII, as the NFL playoffs start on January 14th. The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers are the two favorites to meet in the big game. Three years ago, these two teams met in the Super Bowl, with the Chiefs winning the game. No matter what, fans can expect an amazing game filled with awesome plays and hilarious commercials. Another thing that fans can look forward to aside from the game is the halftime show, as one of the most influential singers and businesswomen in the world, Rihanna, will be the headliner at the break.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJorqGZpGLBqrnEZqCsZaSdsm6%2F1Kmcq2WSpMSteZFpaWxlla2upMCMraCmnV2ZrrWxjJqlnWWcpLCiwMiopWanlmLAtrzEq2Sbp6ehenaDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
