The actor is well-known throughout the world for his excellent performance, and the big screen has taken notice of his magnetism. But it’s not just one aspect of his life that has garnered him notoriety.</p><p>The media has become interested in Morgan as a result of his relationships with numerous women at various points in time. In the business, he has also been called a “notorious womanizer.” Jeanette Adair Bradshaw is one of the women he had a romantic relationship with. She was the one who supported him during his time of trouble when no one else did. But the general public knows very little about her. So, who is Jeanette Adair Bradshaw in real life?</p><h3>How did Jeanette Meet Morgan Freeman?</h3><p>The history of Jeanette and Morgan begins when Morgan was still a struggling professional. Early in the 1960s, when Morgan had nothing except his talent, the two individuals met. The specifics of how they originally came into contact with one another are still a historical mystery. However, it is known that when Bradshaw met Morgan, she already had a child, and Morgan welcomed her along with the child.</p><p>Jeanette was there for Morgan no matter the weather, whether it was sunny, cloudy, or rainy. She was the only one with whom Morgan could openly express his emotions. As they were able to connect with one other perfectly, the couple’s understanding became deeper and deeper. The other person supported the person who was making an attempt to improve their life by standing like a rock.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jeanette-Adair-Bradshaw.jpg.jpg alt="morgan freeman,e&amp;#039;dena hines,deena freeman,morgan freeman children,morgan freeman net worth,morgan freeman wife,jeanette adair bradshaw age,jeanette adair bradshaw wikipedia,jeanette adair bradshaw now,jeanette adair bradshaw morgan freeman,jeanette adair bradshaw photo,jeanette adair bradshaw wiki,what happened to jeanette adair bradshaw,jeanette adair bradshaw idade,jeanette adair bradshaw net worth,how old is jeanette adair bradshaw,morgan freeman jeanette adair bradshaw" width=265 height=384 sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Marriage with Morgan Freeman that Wasn’t Meant to Last Forever</h3><p>Before exchanging vows in a private ceremony, the couple dated for five years. On October 22, 1967, the couple exchanged wedding vows. As soon as they were married, Morgan’s career took off dramatically. He set a new career standard and had enormous success.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ua26b76633a94877796267c614dc4b46a><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Denzel Washington's Net Worth: How Much Money Did The Legendary Actor Make?</span></a><p>Up until 1979, when the couple’s divorce became public knowledge, all was fine between them. The pair filed for separation after 12 years of being husband and wife. The couple’s exact motivation for making such a severe choice is still a mystery. However, a lot of tabloids at the time asserted that Morgan’s extramarital affairs were the cause of their breakup. On November 19, 1979, Bradshaw and Freeman’s divorce became legally binding.</p><h3>Jeanette’s Children: Two Biological and Two Adopted</h3><p>Morgan and Jeanette raised four children together throughout the course of their twelve-year courtship. However, only Morgana Freeman, one of them, is their biological child. The kid rarely makes public appearances, however in 2013, she went with her father to the Los Angeles premiere of the film “Oblivion.”</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Morgana-Freeman.jpg.jpg alt="morgan freeman,e&amp;#039;dena hines,deena freeman,morgan freeman children,morgan freeman net worth,morgan freeman wife,jeanette adair bradshaw age,jeanette adair bradshaw wikipedia,jeanette adair bradshaw now,jeanette adair bradshaw morgan freeman,jeanette adair bradshaw photo,jeanette adair bradshaw wiki,what happened to jeanette adair bradshaw,jeanette adair bradshaw idade,jeanette adair bradshaw net worth,how old is jeanette adair bradshaw,morgan freeman jeanette adair bradshaw" width=297 height=214 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The oldest child of Morgan is Alfonso Rene Freeman, who was born following his father’s brief liaison with Loletha Polk-Adkins. Alfonso, who was born on September 13, 1959, is his famous father’s younger sibling. Along with having a similar appearance to his father, he also enjoys acting. In films like The Shawshank Redemption, The Bucket List, Burn, and others, Alfonso has played the lead role.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alfonso-Freeman-1.jpg alt="morgan freeman,e&amp;#039;dena hines,deena freeman,morgan freeman children,morgan freeman net worth,morgan freeman wife,jeanette adair bradshaw age,jeanette adair bradshaw wikipedia,jeanette adair bradshaw now,jeanette adair bradshaw morgan freeman,jeanette adair bradshaw photo,jeanette adair bradshaw wiki,what happened to jeanette adair bradshaw,jeanette adair bradshaw idade,jeanette adair bradshaw net worth,how old is jeanette adair bradshaw,morgan freeman jeanette adair bradshaw" width=390 height=203 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The third child of Morgan, who was born in 1960, is Saifoulaye Freeman. He was the outcome of Morgan’s illicit relationship with a woman whose specifics have not been made public. Deena Adair is Morgan and Jeanette’s fourth child as well. After Morgan married Jeanette Adair Bradshaw, he adopted her.</p><h3>Bradshaw’s Life Post Divorce: Where is Jeanette Now?</h3><p>Since her romance with Morgan came to an end, Jeanette Adair Bradshaw has avoided the <a href=#>spotlight</a>. She made the decision to live a quiet life after divorcing Morgan in order to avoid the media attention. Similar to Jeanette, who never got married again following her disastrous union with Morgan. It appears that she had a pretty negative marriage experience and was unable to consider dating anybody else.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u39f4b52afc25698a543a1d9515217a6c><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Best Morgan Freeman Movies You Should Have Already Seen</span></a><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jeanettes-ex-hubby-with-Myrna-Colley-Lee-1.jpg alt="morgan freeman,e&amp;#039;dena hines,deena freeman,morgan freeman children,morgan freeman net worth,morgan freeman wife,jeanette adair bradshaw age,jeanette adair bradshaw wikipedia,jeanette adair bradshaw now,jeanette adair bradshaw morgan freeman,jeanette adair bradshaw photo,jeanette adair bradshaw wiki,what happened to jeanette adair bradshaw,jeanette adair bradshaw idade,jeanette adair bradshaw net worth,how old is jeanette adair bradshaw,morgan freeman jeanette adair bradshaw" width=237 height=266 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In contrast, in 1986, her ex-husband Morgan wed Myrna Colley-Lee. His second marriage, however, also ended in divorce. On September 15, 2010, Morgan and Myrna announced their separation after 25 years of dating. His extramarital activities were once more the main cause of the divorce.</p><p>After the divorce, Jeanette didn’t appear in public again until 2015. She appeared with her ex-husband Morgan during the funeral of her cherished granddaughter E’dena Hines in August 2015. Her boyfriend Lamar Davenport killed Hines in a horrible manner.</p><h3>Bradshaw’s Granddaughter Was Brutally Murdered</h3><p>When Bradshaw’s granddaughter E’dena Hines passed away on August 16, 2015, she had to endure heartache. The mother of E’dena Hines was Deena Adair. She was subsequently adopted by Morgan and Myrna Colley-Lee, his second wife.</p><p>Her partner fatally stabbed the 33-year-old woman outside her residence in Washington, New York, 25 times. For the crime he committed, Lamar received a 20-year sentence. He stated in court that she had a sexual relationship with Morgan, which is what made him lose his temper and kill her. Hines and Freeman have both refuted the accusations, though. When still living, Hines made the following statement:</p><p>These rumors about my grandfather and myself are upsetting to my family as well as being inaccurate.</p><p>Hollywood hairstylist Deena Adair, Jeanette’s daughter, gave an emotional testimony in front of the Manhattan Supreme Court during the bench trial of alleged murderer Lamar Davenport. She explained that she was unable to raise her and that she was attempting to mend her ties with her deceased daughter. She uttered:</p><p>We took a car to Jamaica, Queens, to visit the residence that once belonged to my grandparents. To simply reflect, go about, and chat about our experiences.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub63504a1162c14b73fa47bf8bb2cfbc8><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Saifoulaye Freeman, Morgan Freeman's Son And What He Does For A Living</span></a><p>For a mother who had just reconnected with her daughter after a long separation, that is a very sad time. The passing of the aspiring actress is a great loss for both her family and the film business. She had just wrapped up filming for her movie “Landing Up” when she passed away.
