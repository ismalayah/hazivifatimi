She was reportedly born in Sussex and now resides in London, but travels often given her very cool Instagram feed. Argy first began posting on TikTok in March 2021, starting with lip-syncing videos (we’ve all been there) before transitioning to more comedic storytimes and short clips. Almost immediately after she started posting, Argy began to amass a following on the app because viewers enjoyed her humor and knack for making even the most mundane interactions into a fascinating story.</p><p data-characters=637 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>Thanks to her wit and her charming good looks, Argy began monetizing her content and soon landed brand deals with Spotify and Coach offshoot, Coachtopia. In September of 2022, she started posting her podcast on YouTube, where each video is viewed in the hundreds of thousands. On YouTube, Argy usually talks about topics related to sexuality, identity, feminism, relationships, friendship, and has gained even more of a following for her takes on complicated subjects. Her videos opening up about her queer identity as well as the ones where she gives advice seem to resonate the most among her viewers, growing her following even more.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=false>Aside from her own content, Argy is also on people’s minds given her potential relationship with London-based rapper Central Cee. The two have been rumored to be dating since September of last year and frequently pop up in each other’s Instagram posts, but neither has officially confirmed if they’re together. Now that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Argy has signed with Alex Cooper’s Unwell Network</a>, expect more projects from the social media star in the near future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTOZqCsZZ2Wsaa4yKecZpminMZurc2dZLCgqWK2tHnToZxmnZ6cuaq%2Fx2aroqOkpLhuv9OaqWarn2KzornOrqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
