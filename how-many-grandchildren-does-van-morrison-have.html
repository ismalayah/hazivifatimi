Through his two marriages, Morrison has had three children. According to the <a href=#>New Zealand Herald</a>, Morrison married Rigsbee, his American girlfriend, while living in the U.S. near the beginning of his career in part because he was afraid he would get deported. Together, they had a daughter, Shana Morrison, who has since become a <a href=#>successful singer</a> in her own right, and was also Morrison's only child until his 60s. Shana, now 52, has never been married and has no children of her own.</p><p>Morrison and Rigsbee got divorced in 1973, when Shana was only 3 years old. Then, per the <a href=#>Belfast Telegraph</a>, Morrison met Rocca nearly two decades later at a dinner party in Ireland in 1992. Rocca, an Irish celebrity herself, was a presenter of <a href=#>RTÉ</a>, Ireland's public broadcasting corporation, and made headlines as the <a href=#>winner of Miss Ireland</a> in 1980. Although the exact date of their marriage is unclear, they did get married at some point that decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Rocca already had three children from two separate relationships, meaning that Morrison gained three stepchildren. Several years later, the two had <a href=#>their own children</a> together — daughter Aibhe in 2006, and son Fionn in 2007. Given how, apart from Shana, Morrison's oldest biological child is only 16 as of 2022, it makes sense that he doesn't yet have any grandchildren.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxmbYV4e8eormalkaPGbrPRmqWdm5ieuaW%2BxKdknaeVqHq3rc1mpKiqop7AsLqMoZivnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
