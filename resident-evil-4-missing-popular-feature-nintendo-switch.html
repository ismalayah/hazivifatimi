Not only is this widely regarded as one of the best entries into the Resident Evil franchise, but it’s also often hailed as one of the best video games ever made. Period.</p><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=45 data-injectable=false>There are just a couple of problems, however.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=45 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/deal-get-resident-evil-4-on-your-ps4-for-999-social-640x360.jpg alt="Residet Evil 4" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>One is kind of subjective, but veterans of the Wii version of RE 4 really dug the motion controls. Seeing as how that was also a Nintendo console, it’s come as a surprise to some that feature didn’t carry over to the Switch port. Personally, I prefer classic-style controls, but to each their own. Still, it’d have been for the best if everything carried over so that everyone be appeased.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>The other complaint being voiced is that of the $30 price tag. For a game that originally debuted in January of 2005, that’s admittedly somewhat steep. I think $20 may have been more ideal, but let’s not forget Capcom’s tradition of porting the hell out of various RE titles. Come to think of it, the GameCube translations of RE 2, 3 and CODE: Veronica X were a bit pricier when they hit shelves in 2003 – and will now cost you a prettier penny years later.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>For more on <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong> for Nintendo Switch, be sure to check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">our review</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoqZ6rmZmyr8CMnq2ipF1peq610qygp59dpbyxwcuaqWaelZbBtr7EZqWipqSau6W7jKyuoqyTnXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
