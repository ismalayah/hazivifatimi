If this is the first time youâ€™ve heard of Bobbi, youâ€™re in for a ride. She hosts a podcast titled The Really Good Podcast with Bobbi Althoff, where she interviews celebrities <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">using an almost disinterested, sarcastic persona</a> â€” think of a blend between Philomena Cunk and Amelia Dimoldenberg, but much less refined. The type of persona that is adored by many, and despised by many more.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>The fact that she interviews actual celebrities with some of the most off-the-wall and unhinged questions imaginable is reason enough to get her to instant viral podcaster status. However, it was during her interview with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake</a></strong> that Althoff truly gained everyoneâ€™s attention. Fans and Twitter users went wild with theories regarding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a possible entanglement between the two</a>, fueled by their blatantly flirtatious mood. But did it actually happen?</p><h2 id=h-were-bobbi-althoff-and-drake-together data-injectable=false>Were Bobbi Althoff and Drake together?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bobbi Althoffâ€™s husband is reportedly filing for divorce.</p><p>The couple split in July 2023 due to irreconcilable differences. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r7rvxdNP6F</a></p>â€” RapTV (@Rap) <a href=#>February 7, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>There is really no way to know if Althoff and Drake ever slept together â€” and truthfully, it is hardly any of our business. At the same time, itâ€™s very understandable to see where this question comes from. Bobbi Althoff just announced her separation from her now ex-husband, Cory Althoff, leading fans to speculate and assume that Drake was the reason behind their divorce.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>This past week was also eventful for the hip-hop artist, to say the least. After a highly inappropriate video allegedly featuring the rapper surfaced on social media, Drake immediately became everyoneâ€™s favorite topic once again. Of course, this led to speculation running amok, as social media users quickly jumped on the Drake/Bobbi bandwagon, assuming that her divorce was due to her chemistry with the rapper, and because of the very video I just mentioned.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@dailymail href=#>@dailymail</a><p>Bobbi Althoffâ€™s husband has filed for divorce, 6 months after she denied having an affair with Drake ðŸ‘€ <a title=divorce href=#>#divorce</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=bobbialthoff href=#>#bobbialthoff</a> <a title=drake href=#>#drake</a> <a title=scandal href=#>#scandal</a> <a title=affair href=#>#affair</a> <a title=coryalthoff href=#>#coryalthoff</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Daily Mail" href=#>â™¬ original sound â€“ Daily Mail</a></figure><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>At the same time, there is likely no connection between the two at the moment. Bobbi Althoff once admitted to never wanting to do the Drake interview in the first place â€” which caused her to miss her sonâ€™s first birthday. On the other side of the spectrum, Drake also unfollowed Althoff on social media, promptly followed by Althoff doing the same. It all happened around the time when the podcaster also denied the affair rumors.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>For this reason, there is no indication whatsoever that the duo were ever together. At the time of their episode together, Althoff was still married to her ex-husband, while Drake<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> was likely just adding more diamonds to his engagement necklace</a>. Either way, it might be best to lay off all the rumors unless you wish to be hit with Aubreyâ€™s<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> questionable disses</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxqrCMm6abmplirq3Ax6idn2WRo7FusNGaop5lo6GypryMraagnaSdsrN506GcZqqloryzv4yer6mkkZ67prCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
