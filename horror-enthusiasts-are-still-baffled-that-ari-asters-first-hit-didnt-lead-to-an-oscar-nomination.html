The film is not only deeply disturbing but masterfully directed, with a fantastic music score, great cinematography, and truly phenomenal performances from all the cast, especially Toni Collette and Alex Wolff. If you strip away the horror element, what you are dealing with is a dysfunctional family struggling with one of the most tragic things that can happen, and both Collette and Wolff are mesmerizing to watch in their roles as mother and son that are unable to communicate through their grief.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Though the film did receive widespread critical acclaim, with Collette and Wolff picking up a smattering of nominations and awards from lesser-known awarding bodies, they were not recognized for their performances by any of the bigger awarding organizations. The film was snubbed by the Acadamy Awards, the BAFTAs, and Golden Globes as many horror films often are, which left many fans a little put out.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Even to this day, people are still discovering the fantastic horror film and are left wondering why on earth there wasn’t more recognition for both the director and his stars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Watched Hereditary again and im just baffled that Toni Collette was never nominated for an Oscar.</a><br>by <a href=#>u/CreepyAssociation173</a> in <a href=#>horror</a></figure><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>This OP points out some of the moments in Hereditary that they believe earned Collette her Oscar, including the difficult-to-watch dinner scene.
